Murray Benjamin, rotating the various TV press outlets in and out of their rooms for their 4-minute interview segments.

I’ve married these two passions by volunteering as part of the Rooster Teeth community every summer since 2014 to be a Guardian (volunteer staff) for RTX in Austin, Texas. I’d imagine an unpaid position in high humidity surrounded by 30,000 nerds is someone’s hell; this summer event is my delight.</p>
            <p>I have nearly 4 years of RTX-specific Personal Assistant experience for Caleb Denecour that has given me an education in the spontaneity of Rooster Teeth by working directly with staff members. I learned quickly how to improvise in the face of unanticipated scenarios, be quick on my feet, defuse upset fans, travel safely between 3 crowded venues and have a sixth sense for where the nearest sharpie is located. I have experience coordinating staff schedules, and being adaptive when those plans change. Between a fire evacuation and working with Achievement Hunter all day, I feel well equipped to handle anything thrown my way.</p>
            <p>My tasks included keeping the Denecour brothers on schedule, assisting with autographs, photos and personal requests, answering questions, and acting as an intermediary between him and the public when necessary. It was a fantastically exhausting experience and I loved every minute of it.</p>
